    "# Understanding a Geek Rating\n",
    "The data set includes two key rating metrics for each board game.\n",
    "- **Average Rating** - The average of all user submitted scores (out of 10).\n",
    "- **Geek Rating** - This is a **Bayesian-adjusted score** used by BoardGameGeek (BGG) to provide a fairer ranking for games.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bayesian average is used to adjust the games rating based on:\n",
    "- The number of votes received (**v**).\n",
    "- The average rating (**r**).\n",
    "- The overall average rating across all games on BGG (**c**) (the average rating across all games is often around 5.5).\n",
    "- A constant (**m**) is also introduced which determines the minimum number of votes required before a games rating is even considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Geek Rating} = \\frac{v}{v + m} \\cdot R + \\frac{m}{v + m} \\cdot C\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 1 : A new game with just a few votes\n",
    "Let's see a brand new game, with only a few votes. \n",
    "- **R** = 9.0 - an excellent raw average score.\n",
    "- **V** = 25 - only 25 people have rated it so far. However, this would now threaten to be the best game ever from the opinion of only 25 people.\n",
    "- **C** = 5.5 - The average review score of all games on BGG.\n",
    "- **M** = 1000 - The constant, used to determine the minimum number of votes required. Kind of works like a weighting (1000 used for illustrative purposes, the actual constant used by BGG might be different).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets plug all of this into the formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Geek Rating} = \\frac{25}{25 + 1000} \\cdot 9.0 + \\frac{1000}{25 + 1000} \\cdot 5.5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "= 0.024 \\cdot 9.0 + 0.976 \\cdot 5.5 = 0.22 + 5.37 = \\mathbf{5.59}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduces the rating from **9.0** to **5.59**! Our new game will need a much higher volume of positive reviews to climb to the top spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example 2 : CATAN - A very popular game released in 1995\n",
    "- **R** = 7.09\n",
    "- **V** = 132623 \n",
    "- **C** = 5.5 \n",
    "- **M** = 1000\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, lets plug all of this into the formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Geek Rating} = \\frac{132623}{132623 + 1000} \\cdot 7.09 + \\frac{1000}{132623 + 1000} \\cdot 5.5\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "= 0.993 \\cdot 7.09 + 0.976 \\cdot 5.5 = 7.04 + 0.04 = \\mathbf{7.08}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the high volume of ratings for CATAN, the Geek Rating does not differ much from the non-adjusted average, going from **7.09** to **7.08**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use this calculation?\n",
    "The geek rating is designed to prevent games with just a few (potentially biased) scores from ranking too high or too low.\n",
    "In this project I will be using the Geek Rating to assess a game's **overall perceived quality**, since it accounts for both rating score and the number of votes."
