    "- Some games do not have a release year. Perhaps no one knows when these games were released. Anyway, they were removed from the dataset reducing the total by a further 276 to 37,783 games. Games without a release year included things like Go Fish and Poker Dice etc.\n",
    "- Some games did not feature a \"Game ID\" or a \"Rank\". These were often game expansions and second editions. These were all excluded removing a further 10,943 leaving 26,840. That's still a lot of games! I have decided to remove these from the initial analysis as initially, I just want to determine the features of the original game to see if it is a classic. For a game to have a second edition or expansion, it must have garnered some level of success, which we could analyze later on. I also dont want the rating of the original game to be influences by and expansions or second editions, yet.\n",
    "- Any duplicate \"Game ID\" were also removed, just in case, but there were no duplicates, but seemed silly to remove the code which was doing no harm.\n",
    "- Lastly, I removed any games released in 2024. This is because I want to work with full years worth of data. This ensured every game on the list can contain at least one years worth of data. This removed another 1,045 games.\n",

    "# Understanding a Geek Rating\n",
    "The dataset includes two key rating metrics for each board game.\n",
    "- **Average Rating** - The average of all user submitted scores (out of 10).\n",
    "- **Geek Rating** - This is a **Bayesian-adjusted score** used by BoardGameGeek (BGG) to provide a fairer ranking for games.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bayesian average is used to adjust the games rating based on:\n",
    "- The number of votes received (v).\n",
    "- The average rating (r).\n",
    "- The overall average rating across all games on BGG (c) (the average rating across all games is often around 5.5).\n",
    "- A constant (m) is also introduced which determines the minimum number of votes required before a games rating is even considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Geek Rating} = \\frac{v}{v + m} \\cdot R + \\frac{m}{v + m} \\cdot C\n",

    "# Example 1 : A new game with just a few votes\n",
    "Let's see a brand new game, with only a few votes. \n",
    "- **R** = 9.0 - an excellent raw average score.\n",
    "- **V** = 25 - only 25 people have rated it so far. However, this would now threaten to be the best game ever from the opinion of only 25 people.\n",
    "- **C** = 5.5 - The average review score of all games on BGG.\n",
    "- **M** = 1000 - The constant, used to determine the minimum number of votes required. Kind of works like a weighting (1000 used for illustrative purposes, the actual constant used by BGG might be different).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets plug all of this into the formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Geek Rating} = \\frac{25}{25 + 1000} \\cdot 9.0 + \\frac{1000}{25 + 1000} \\cdot 5.5\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
