    "- Some games did not feature a \"Game ID\" or a \"Rank\". These were often game expansions and second editions. These were all excluded removing a further 10,943 leaving 26,840. That's still a lot of games!\n",
    "- Any duplicate \"Game ID\" were also removed, just in case, but there were no duplicates, but seemed silly to remove the code which was doing no harm.\n",
