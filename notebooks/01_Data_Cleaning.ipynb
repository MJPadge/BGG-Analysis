That's still a lot of games! I have decided to remove these from the initial analysis as initially, I just want to determine the features of the original game to see if it is a classic. For a game to have a second edition or expansion, it must have garnered some level of success, which we could analyze later on. I also dont want the rating of the original game to be influences by and expansions or second editions, yet.\n",

    "# Understanding a Geek Rating\n",
    "The dataset includes two key rating metrics for each board game.\n",
    "- **Average Rating** - The average of all user submitted scores (out of 10).\n",
    "- **Geek Rating** - This is a **Bayesian-adjusted score** used by BoardGameGeek (BGG) to provide a fairer ranking for games.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bayesian average is used to adjust the games rating based on:\n",
    "- The number of votes received (v).\n",
    "- The average rating (r).\n",
    "- The overall average rating across all games on BGG (c) (the average rating across all games is often around 5.5).\n",
    "- A constant (m) is also introduced which determines the minimum number of votes required before a games rating is even considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Geek Rating} = \\frac{v}{v + m} \\cdot R + \\frac{m}{v + m} \\cdot C\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example 1 : A new game with just a few votes\n",
    "Let's see a brand new game, with only a few votes. \n",
    "- **R** = 9.0 - an excellent raw average score.\n",
    "- **V** = 25 - only 25 people have rated it so far. However, this would now threaten to be the best game ever from the opinion of only 25 people.\n",
    "- **C** = 5.5 - The average review score of all games on BGG.\n",
    "- **M** = 1000 - The constant, used to determine the minimum number of votes required. Kind of works like a weighting (1000 used for illustrative purposes, the actual constant used by BGG might be different).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets plug all of this into the formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Geek Rating} = \\frac{25}{25 + 1000} \\cdot 9.0 + \\frac{1000}{25 + 1000} \\cdot 5.5\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduces the rating from **9.0** to **5.59**! Our new game will need a much higher volume of positive reviews to climb to the top spot.\n",

    "The geek rating is designed to prevent games with just a few (potentially biased) scores from ranking too high or too low.\n",
