    "- Some games did not feature a \"Game ID\" or a \"Rank\". These were often game expansions and second editions. These were all excluded removing a further 10,943 leaving 26,840. That's still a lot of games! I have decided to remove these from the initial analysis as initially, I just want to determine the features of the original game to see if it is a classic. For a game to have a second edition or expansion, it must have garnered some level of success, which we could analyze later on. I also dont want the rating of the original game to be influences by and expansions or second editions, yet.\n",
    "- Any duplicate \"Game ID\" were also removed, just in case, but there were no duplicates, but seemed silly to remove the code which was doing no harm.\n",

    "# Understanding a Geek Rating\n",
    "The dataset includes two key rating metrics for each board game.\n",
    "- **Average Rating** - The average of all user submitted scores (out of 10).\n",
    "- **Geek Rating** - This is a **Bayesian-adjusted score** used by BoardGameGeek (BGG) to provide a fairer ranking for games.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Bayesian average is used to adjust the games rating based on:\n",
    "- The number of votes received (v).\n",
    "- The average rating (r).\n",
    "- The overall average rating across all games on BGG (c) (the average rating across all games is often around 5.5).\n",
    "- A constant (m) is also introduced which determines the minimum number of votes required before a games rating is even considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Geek Rating} = \\frac{v}{v + m} \\cdot R + \\frac{m}{v + m} \\cdot C\n",

    "# Example 1 : A new game with just a few votes\n",
    "Let's see a brand new game, with only a few votes. \n",
    "- **R** = 9.0 - an excellent raw average score.\n",
    "- **V** = 25 - only 25 people have rated it so far. However, this would now threaten to be the best game ever from the opinion of only 25 people.\n",
    "- **C** = 5.5 - The average review score of all games on BGG.\n",
    "- **M** = 1000 - The constant, used to determine the minimum number of votes required. Kind of works like a weighting (1000 used for illustrative purposes, the actual constant used by BGG might be different).\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets plug all of this into the formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Geek Rating} = \\frac{25}{25 + 1000} \\cdot 9.0 + \\frac{1000}{25 + 1000} \\cdot 5.5\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This reduces the rating from **9.0** to **5.59**! Our new game will need a much higher volume of positive reviews to climb to the top spot.\n",

    "The geek rating is designed to prevent games with just a few (potentially biased) scores from ranking too high or too low.\n",

    " - Lastly, I removed any game released after 2019. The reason for this is, I want to have at least 5 complete years worth of data for each game so we can more accurately gauge if a game had a drop off from intitial hype. This is very difficult to determine with less years worth of data. We could potentially look at making \"drop-off\" predictions with newer games following the results of the initial analysis though.\n",

    "# Why change the release year?\n",
    "Looking at the review data and the release year for some games brought something to my attention. Looking at when reviews are received is not fair for games like Pachisi.\n",

    "![Pachisi](../images/Pachisi.png)\n",
    "[Pachisi - Wikipedia] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachisi\n",
    "\n",
    "Pachisi has a BGG release year of 400, and according to the Wikipedia article, it could even be as early as 1100 BC! This presented a couple of issues when trying to assess the popularity of a board game.\n",
    "- On the one hand, Pachisi has had, on average, 1,604 more years to gain traction than modern games.\n",
    "- On the other hand, I want to measure sustained popularity by looking at the average number of votes received per year. This means, in this example, we would take Pachisi's 5,800 votes over 1,624 years giving us 3.57 votes per year since release. That's low, and hardly seems fair when the BGG website itself was only launched in January 2000, so prior to this, votes could not even be logged and measured in this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "# So what do you propose we do about this?\n",
    "The first thing to increase fairness across the board, is to adjust the release year of older games to at least be in line with the launch of BGG in January 2000. I then found that no reviews were posted on the website in the year 2000 and the earliest reviews started to appear in 2001. Therefore any game older than 2001 has had it's release year adjusted to 2001 for the purpose of the anlaysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures all games in the selection have at least 5 full years worth of votes and reviews between 2001 and 2024.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Another thing to consider for later:\n",
    "I also want to factor in the popularity and use of the BGG website itself. If we look at Monopoly for example, we can see the reviews are steadily increasing from 2001 to 2007 after which the volume of reviews received starts to significantly increase, peaking in 2020 (pandemic related lock-down Monopoly plays possibly?) \n",

    "\n",
    "Anyway, my point here is a I think there are a few facotrs that could be at play which need looking into:\n",
    "- **1** - Is the popularity of board games as a whole and the BGG website. Even though people may have owned a game like Monopoly for an eternity (or 1935 at the earliest), could it be du to the rising popularity of the medium as a whole that people feel the desire to leave their thoughts on this timeless classic?Which brings me onto thought number 2.\n",
    "- **2** - The nature under which people decide to leave a review in the first place. Most often this will be to say something is fantastic, or it is rubbish. It is more rare to see the mediocre scoring."
