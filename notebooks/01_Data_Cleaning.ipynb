    "- Some games did not feature a \"Game ID\" or a \"Rank\". These were often game expansions and second editions. These were all excluded removing a further 10,943 leaving 26,840. That's still a lot of games! I have decided to remove these from the initial analysis as initially, I just want to determine the features of the original game to see if it is a classic. For a game to have a second edition or expansion, it must have garnered some level of success, which we could analyze later on. I also dont want the rating of the original game to be influences by and expansions or second editions, yet.\n",

    "\n",
    "A Bayesian average is used to adjust the games rating based on:\n",
    "- The number of votes received (v).\n",
    "- The average rating (r).\n",
    "- The overall average rating across all games on BGG (c) (the average rating across all games is often around 5.5).\n",
    "- A constant (m) is also introduced which determines the minimum number of votes required before a games rating is even considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The formula\n",
    "\n",

    "\\text{Geek Rating} = \\frac{v}{v + m} \\cdot R + \\frac{m}{v + m} \\cdot C\n",

    "- **C** = 5.5 - The average review score of all games on BGG.\n",
    "- **M** = 1000 - The constant, used to determine the minimum number of votes required. Kind of works like a weighting (1000 used for illustrative purposes, the actual constant used by BGG might be different).\n",

    "Lets plug all of this into the formula:\n",
    "$$\n",
