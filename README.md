# Can we predict if a board game will be good?
This project explores the features that make a board game stand out from the crowd. What makes them stand the test of time, and ultimately, gives them that classic status that forms part of every board game fans library. 

## Why?
The board game market has grown significantly in recent years like a popularity snowball of plastic and cardboard. I am a long time fan of the hobby and would like to combine my passion for data, with my passion for board games to see what we find.

## Key Questions

- Can we measure longevity and popularity objectively?
- Can we measure the early buzz vs the sustained attention?
- Can we measure the perceived quality?
